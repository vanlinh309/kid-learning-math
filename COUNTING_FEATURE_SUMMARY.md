   - Fixed emoji display (👁️ for recognize, 🔢 for counting)

3. **`src/components/Layout.tsx`**
   - Updated data conversion to handle counting questions
   - Properly parses counting answer format: `{ image_url, correct_number }`
   - Converts to blocks format for consistency

4. **`src/utils/supabase.ts`**

   - Now accepts optional category parameter for filtering
   - Returns only questions matching the specified category

## 🗂️ Database Structure

  "image_url": "main-question-image.jpg",
  "category": "counting"
}
```

**Answer Table:**
```json
{
  "question_id": "uuid",
  "title": "Answer 1",
  "content": {
    "image_url": "https://example.com/apples.jpg",
    "correct_number": 5
  },
  "type": "free_choice",
  "is_correct": true
}
```
