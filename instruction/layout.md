I want to create a responsive web layout with requirements as below:

The screen is split into two main parts:

**Left side**: A collapsible sidebar menu.

**Right side**: The lesson content area.

## Sidebar (Left Panel):

- Can be shown or hidden by clicking a small toggle button (e.g., hamburger icon).
- Contains a search box at the top to filter lessons.
- Menu items are grouped by category (lesson line):
**Example menu items:**
	- Counting
	- Count to 3
	- Count to 4
- Constructing Object
	- Find image to complete object
- If there are many items, the sidebar should be scrollable.
- The sidebar should look clean with padding, hover effects, and smooth transitions.

## Right Panel (Main Content):
- Displays the content of the selected lesson.
- For now, just show placeholder text like “Select a lesson” or “Lesson: Count to 3”.
- The layout should be responsive (works well on desktop and tablet).
- When the sidebar is hidden, the content area should expand to full width.
- Include a nice transition animation when showing/hiding the sidebar.
