Create a React component for a kids' counting activity.

Requirements:
- The component teaches children how to count objects by using images.
- The page should start with 3 "answer blocks" by default.
- Include a button labeled "Add More" that allows users to dynamically add more blocks.

Each answer block should contain:
1. A text input field where the user can paste an image URL.
2. When a valid URL is entered, display a preview of the image below the URL textbox.
3. A second text input below the image preview where the user can enter the correct number of objects counted in that image.

Additional details:
- Ensure that each new block behaves the same as the default ones.
- Use basic, kid-friendly styling (colorful, simple layout).
- Write clean, commented code using functional components and hooks (no class components).
